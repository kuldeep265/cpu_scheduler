🧠 CPU Scheduling Algorithm Simulator

A web-based interactive simulator for visualizing and understanding various CPU scheduling algorithms commonly used in operating systems.

🚀 Features Support for multiple CPU scheduling algorithms:

✅ First Come First Serve (FCFS)

✅ Shortest Job First (SJF)

✅ Round Robin (RR)

✅ Priority Scheduling

Interactive visualization with:

📊 Dynamic Gantt chart

📅 Timeline visualization

⚙️ Process management interface

📈 Real-time performance metrics

📏 Performance Metrics The simulator calculates and displays:

⏱️ Average Waiting Time

🔁 Average Turnaround Time

📌 Throughput

🧮 CPU Utilization

🛠️ Usage Select a scheduling algorithm from the dropdown menu

If using Round Robin, specify the time quantum

Add processes using the "Add Process" button

For each process, specify:

📥 Arrival Time

🔧 Burst Time

⭐ Priority (for Priority Scheduling)

Click "Submit" to visualize the scheduling

View the results in the Gantt chart and metrics table

Use "Clear All" to reset and start over
